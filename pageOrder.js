/***
* pageOrder.js  
*
* Defines which pages to use in this game,
* and in which order. Allows you to have a 
* bank of many ciphers for different age and
* skill levels, and slot them into place as
* desired.
* 
* FACT: You don't need the numbers syntactically.
* BUT: They make it easier to see what you are doing.
* So please be kind to the next developer & use them. 
* Thank you.
